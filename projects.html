                <h2>LBM (Library Book Manager)</h2>
                <p>A group project I took part in creating in my 1st Year in CS, written in Python. Its main function is to retrieve
                    information about a library's catalogue of books through SQLite, and allow users to easily request to borrow books
                    from the given selection (as long as they're marked available for borrowing). It also allows users to request additions
                    to the library by filling in a form. Lastly, admins can directly manage the database by logging in using an authorized
                    username and password.

                <h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>
                <p>A game created as the output for a research project I took part in in 10th Grade. Knowledge is Power was created in GameMaker Studio
                    written in its proprietary programming language, "GML (GameMaker Language)". The game is similar in structure to that of a quiz,
                    the player must answer questions by choosing among 4 choices. The game keeps going endlessly until the player makes a wrong choice,
                    upon which the game ends and the player is prompted to return to the title screen.
